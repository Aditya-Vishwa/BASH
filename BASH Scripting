BASH stands for:

And in Linux OS to interect with linux we us BASH Scripting.

#! means BASH Shebang

It is used to tell the operating system which interpreter to use to parse the rest of the file.

Steps to create and execute BASH Script:

Step 1: Create a BASH Script eg. nano first.sh 

Step 2: Make file executable by changing the permission of file and adding execute permission by using:

chmod +x first.sh

Step 3: Run the script by using:

bash first.sh or ./first.sh
